# Salkantay To Machu Picchu Peru
The Salkantay Trek to Machu Picchu is an alternative to the Inca Trail. It is considered by most to be the best alternative route. We think it’s the best route! Not only because of the rampant beauty you will encounter, but also because of the lack of people. Because it is more rugged and remote, the Salkantay Trek is significantly less populated than the Inca Trail. With formidable views and awe-inspiring vistas, this path less traveled has an unquantifiable value. It is truly, as deemed by the Inca, sacred.
Our five day Salkantay Trek to Machu Picchu is perfect for adventurers who are looking to experience Peru’s ever-changing landscapes. Day by day you will travel through changing ecosystems and scenery: from sweeping, magical landscapes and snowy mountains to a tropical jungle paradise. Along the way, you will see a wide variety of wildlife, medicinal plants, and flower varieties. Witness, with your own eyes, a living, and ancient, culture in remote villages hardly ever visited by foreigners!

We will be hiking through the Cordillera Vilcabamba. This is an impressive mountain range that runs for over 260 km. The snow-capped mountain, Salkantay (or Salcantay), rises to 6271 MASL (20574 FASL) in height. Salkantay’s prominent peak is located less than fifty miles northwest of the city of Cusco in south-central Peru. It is viewed as a sacred mountain by many locals and has been climbed by professional mountaineers since 1952.

Due to her high altitude and steep slopes, you will need a reasonable level of fitness to complete the Salkantay Trek. But age shouldn't be a barrier! The most important thing is to be well-acclimatized to the altitude. The highest point you will reach on the trek is (4, 650 MASL – 15092 FASL). We recommend at least two days of acclimatization before your journey. This is an ideal time for visiting the city of Cusco, its nearby Inca ruins, and the Sacred Valley of the Incas.
